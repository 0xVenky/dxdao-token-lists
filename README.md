# DXdao token lists

Umbrella project for DXdao's token lists.

## Usage

In order to generate and/or update a list for a given protocol, update its token files under `tokens/${protocolName}` (token files for Swapr for example will be under `tokens/swapr`).

Once all the updates have been done, the list can be generated by running the `build:${protocolName}` command. The semver-compatible version string must be passed as an additional parameter.

All the generated lists are written under the `lists` folder.

## Adding a new project/protocol

In order to add a supported protocol, it is required to add one or more JSON files containing supported tokens information for the project in the `tokens/${protocolName}` folder.
Even though not required, it's highly suggested for these files to be subdivided by network, in order to improve clarity (for example, the `rinkeby.json` file must only contain tokens with a chain id of 4).

It's then required to add a generation script in `package.json`.
The script will generally be named `build:${protocolName}` and the command will be in the form `ts-node ./scripts/build-list.ts ${protocolName} ${listLogoURI}`.

It should be trivial to add new lists.
